# StylIQ Data Moat: Investor Summary

## The Competitive Advantage

StylIQ captures **first-party shopping intent signals** that major platforms cannot access. While Google and Meta see ad clicks and Facebook profiles, StylIQ observes the complete product consideration journey: which sizes users try before committing, how long they deliberate before bookmarking, which brands they return to across sessions, and the exact price points that trigger action.

## Core Data Assets

| Signal                          | What It Reveals                       | Competitive Moat                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Size-Switch Frequency**       | Fit uncertainty per product/brand     | Enables fit prediction no retailer has |
| **Cross-Session Product Views** | High-intent "sleeping on it" behavior | Predicts conversion timing             |
| **Brand Affinity Scores**       | Weighted brand preference over time   | Powers personalized recommendations    |
| **Time-to-Action**              | Seconds from view to bookmark/cart    | Measures purchase friction             |
| **Price History Tracking**      | Price sensitivity thresholds          | Optimal discount targeting             |
| **Scroll Depth + Dwell Time**   | Engagement quality per page           | Separates browsing from buying         |

## Why This Data Is Defensible

1. **First-Party Collection**: All data collected with explicit opt-in consent inside the StylIQ browser. No third-party cookies, no cross-site tracking, no privacy risk.

2. **Contextual Richness**: Unlike pixel-based tracking, StylIQ observes in-page interactions (size clicks, color selections, scroll behavior) that external trackers cannot see.

3. **Intent Purity**: Users open StylIQ specifically to shop for fashion. Every signal is high-intent, unlike general browsing data polluted by research, entertainment, or accidental clicks.

4. **Compounding Network Effect**: As the user base grows, aggregate patterns (e.g., "users who view X also convert on Y") become more accurate, making recommendations stickier.

- **Brand partnerships**: Sell anonymized trend reports showing emerging brand preferences
- **Premium features**: Offer "price drop alerts" and "fit predictions" as subscription upsells
- **Advertising**: High-intent, first-party audiences for fashion brand campaigns
